#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-37436

Description: A vulnerability in the Linux kernel was found in the way the __get_user_pages() function handles the VMA flags. An attacker with access to a user namespace and CAP_SYS_ADMIN can use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Severity Score: * Critical


Attack Vectors: * Local
* Privileged user

Possible Attacks: * Denial of service (system crash)
* Arbitrary code execution

Impact: * Crashing the system could lead to data loss or downtime.
* Executing arbitrary code could allow an attacker to take control of the system.

Root Cause: * The __get_user_pages() function does not properly handle the VMA flags.

Patch/Remediation: * The Linux kernel has been patched to fix this vulnerability.

Threat Score Impact: * Very High

Possibility of Threat: * High

Vulnerability of Asset: * High

#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-36760

Description: A flaw was found in the way the Linux kernel's ext4 filesystem handles certain file operations. A local attacker could use this flaw to cause a denial of service (system crash) or, potentially, escalate their privileges.

Severity Score: * 7.8 (High)


Attack Vectors: * Local access
* Unprivileged user

Possible Attacks: * Denial of service (system crash)
* Privilege escalation

Impact: * Crashing the system could lead to data loss or service disruption.
* Privilege escalation could allow an attacker to gain complete control of the system.

Root Cause: * A flaw in the ext4 filesystem's handling of certain file operations

Patch/Remediation: * The Linux kernel has been updated to address this issue. Users are advised to update their kernels to the latest version.

Threat Score Impact: * Very High

Possibility of Threat: * High

Vulnerability of Asset: * High

#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-31813

Description: A vulnerability has been identified in the way that the Linux kernel handles certain USB device requests. An attacker with physical access to a vulnerable system could use this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code as root.

Severity Score: * 7.5 (Critical)


Attack Vectors: * Direct physical access to a vulnerable system

Possible Attacks: * Execute arbitrary code as root

Impact: * Complete compromise of a vulnerable system

Root Cause: * A flaw in the Linux kernel's USB device handling code

Patch/Remediation: * The affected kernel versions can be patched with the following updates:

Threat Score Impact: * Very High

Possibility of Threat: * High

Vulnerability of Asset: * High

#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-30556

Description: The Linux kernel before 5.17.13 allows local users to gain privileges by leveraging an out-of-bounds write in the kernel's tty_set_termios function.

Severity Score: * 7.5 (High)


Attack Vectors: * Local

Possible Attacks: * Privilege escalation

Impact: * A local user could gain privileges by leveraging this vulnerability.

Root Cause: * An out-of-bounds write in the kernel's tty_set_termios function.

Patch/Remediation: * The Linux kernel 5.17.13 or later includes a patch for this vulnerability.

Threat Score Impact: * High

Possibility of Threat: * High

Vulnerability of Asset: * High

#  CVE ID: CVE-2022-29404

Description: A vulnerability in the Linux kernel was found in the way the __x86_64_sys_mremap system call handles the MADV_DONTNEED advice. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

Severity Score: * 7.5 (High)


Attack Vectors: * Local

Possible Attacks: * Denial of service (system crash)
* Code execution

Impact: * A denial of service (system crash) could occur if a local attacker is able to send a specially crafted system call to the kernel.
* Code execution could occur if a local attacker is able to send a specially crafted system call to the kernel and then exploit a memory corruption vulnerability.

Root Cause: * The __x86_64_sys_mremap system call does not properly handle the MADV_DONTNEED advice.

Patch/Remediation: * The Linux kernel has been updated to fix this vulnerability. Users are advised to update their kernels to the latest version.

Threat Score Impact: * Very High

Possibility of Threat: * High

Vulnerability of Asset: * High
